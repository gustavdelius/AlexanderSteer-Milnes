# Meeting log

## 23/11/21

We agree that Alexander will look at ways to compare the output of mizer models to corresponding diet data.
This is novel territory and there is much scope for experimentation on how to best do it.
Alexander will start by looking into the predator/prey mass ratio as a summary of the prey distribution
and will write his preliminary report about this. After that his first task will be to calculate and plot the
predator/prey mass ratio in a mizer model as a function of predator size and compare that to a similar
calculation and plot for the diet data.

## 30/11/21

We take a brief look at the stomach data from NIWA and Alexander quickly
comes up with a good question which we pass on to Samik, together with a request
to give Alexander direct access to the data and the model. 

We'll talk about Samik's mizer model when we meet next in January.
